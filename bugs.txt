1. The Queue seems to behave as a stack. See test10. The Queue will dequeue values in a LIFO order instead of FIFO how a queue should be.
    - i.e. The queue is either enqueuing on the front or dequeuing from the back
2. The destructor of the Queue seems to not be working since valgrind reports memory leaks after just constructing a Queue and inserting a single element
    However, dequeue seems to be properly deleting nodes, so the issue is most likely just with the destructor.
